        Brewhaha was constructed on the good virtues and thirstiness of three wise explorers.  They knew that there was not enough goodness in their beverage selection and decided to change that.  Brewhaha was founded in 1995 in order to provide change in the way that they Denver community experiences drinking.  Their phone app provides smart decision making with a built-in BAC calculator.
